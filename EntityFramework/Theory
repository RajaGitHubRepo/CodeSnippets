By defalut saveChanges() method of dbcontext updates are considered as a single unit of work and completes in a transaction. 
Different states of Entities: Add, modified, deleted, unchanged, detached.

if you have multiple saeChanges() calls in a loop then you may consider using transaction (like open a transaction and call save 
chnages in the loop) and Close transacion). becasue for single SaveChanges() mehtod you don't need to use open/close transaction. it 
is automatically taken care by enitity frame work. 


AsNoTracking() -> you may use this mehtod when you are getting the results, because you dont want to remmeber the context (or aware of 
the changes happend to your repository -(disable change tracking) because you are not updating or deleting or addding any to be tracked by
the context). 

By using code first approach and fluent api/data annotations you can create and setup tables from code.
