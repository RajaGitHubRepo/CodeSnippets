In order to query using Entity framework 

first you need a Model (You can create model using Entity Data model)

second you need context (class) your application can interact with Enitties

One of the recomended way to work with DBContext is define a class that is derieved from DBContext
and exposes DbSet Properties collection.

Life time :
-------------
Life time of hte context begins when the context is created and ends when the context is disposed
or garbage collected.
public void UseProducts()
{
    using (var context = new ProductContext())
    {     
        // Perform data access using the context
    }
}
Connection :
--------------
By default, the context manages connections to the database.the context opens and closes the 
connection as needed.

Configuration :  

Performace : cold query / warm query 
cold query : first time it takes time (cold query)
warm query : from second time onwards the query will take less time.
