1.Static classes and static members : 
=====================================
Static clasess can not be instanciated. In other words you can not use NEW keyword to create instance of a static class.
You access the members of a static class by using class name.

For example, if you have a static class that is named Utility that has a public method named 
MethodA, you call the method as shown in the following example:

Utility.MethodA();  // Example Math class in dot net framework. All the methods of Math class does not depends 
on instance variables.

A non-static class can have both static and non-static members so that the static members
apply to the class, whereas the non-static members apply to the instances of that class.


2.Sealed classes and Sealed Members :
=====================================
Sealed class declaration restricts the creation of derieved object. Similarly a sealed method can not be 
override. A normal class can have sealed methods, suppose when you derieve the normal class whcih have sealed members you can not override 
them in derieved class. 

3.Const and Readonly Differences    : The const keyword is used for a value if you are not intended to chage that value through out the 
=====================================
Application. Ex : Pi :3.14 the value of PI Never changes. The readoly keyword is little different from Const. Const value is assigned 
during the declaration, For readonly the value can be assigned during run time in Constructor. in a class multiple constructors can be 
defined with various paramters, and we can assign the readonly values in constructor. 

Const is a compile time value assignment and ReadOnly is a run time value assignment.
