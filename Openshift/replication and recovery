Things will go wrong, and that's why we have replication and recovery
Things will go wrong with your software, or your hardware, or from something out of your control. But we can plan for that failure, 
and planning for it let's us minimize the impact. OpenShift supports this via what we call replication and recovery.


Replication controller takes care of adding new pods (same with different Ip address)

Recovery is a default machanism -when some pods die automaticlaly another same pod will be created for you
