Trouble shooting :

Build config resource : contains build information
On the resources tab you can see if #build is failed or success 
if build is failed you can see log files to see what is the reason for build failure. 
other type of resource is deployment:
 like some of the dependencis which are requrired are not there..
Another type of errors some times, build and deployement succesul, but 
pod level errors can happen.
