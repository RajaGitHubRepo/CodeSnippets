## OSI stands for Open systems Interconnect
This is implemented in 1970, and some layers are depreciated, but this is one of the 
most important concepts you need to lean to understand data networking.

## Physical layer: (twisted pair cabelling, coax cable, fiber otpics cable)
for wireless it is electro magnatic spectrum (Air) in order to transfer.
you can not take bunch of copper wire and make a twisted pair of cabelling.
you need to follow some protocols to design the twisted pair of cabelling. 

Physical layer is used to connect to all of our devices in network. 

## Datalink layer:
Little network sigments that allow us to transfer the data from one device to another
(most of them are Eathenet (wired or with out wire))
The protocol you are using is Ethernet..Ethernet is very fast 
Docsis-3 

## Network layer
IP Addressing and IP routing (its like unique address to send messages ) 
while the Datalink Layer allows us to move data from one device to the next device 
IPAddress and IP routing allows us to end to end communciation.

So Ethernet and (IPAddressing, IPRouting) work very closly with each other
to get messages from one device to anther device. This is called the Network layer.

## Transport layer
Transmission control protocol:
it is like setting up a session between sender and reciever.
in out telephone communication, sender can not directly send the message, 
first he dails to the reciever, it rings and reciever lift the phone, the sender
will start delevering the message.

## Application layer
Hyper text tranfer protocol: Web pages are written in a format called hypertext, it is 
basic formatting
