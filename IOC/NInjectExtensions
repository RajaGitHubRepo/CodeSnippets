Ninject.web.common - it is a base extenion for all ther web extensions (This extension is not intended to be used standalone. At least one is required!). and provides basic infrastructure for all other web type 
extensions (Ninject.web.Mvc, Ninject.Web.WebApi, Ninject.web) 
---------------------------------
Couple of Ninject extensions like 
----------------------------------
Ninject.web.Mvc -- Allows integration between Ninject and MVC
Ninject.web -- Allows integration between Ninject and ASP.NET WebForms
Ninject.Web.WebApi --Allows integration between Ninject and WEBAPI

How NInject constructs types for you ? 
--------------------------------------
When asked to instanciate an object for you, Ninject will look at types available 
public constructors and pick the one with most parameters it knows how to resolve. 
or parameter less constructor if there are not any suitable ones.(there is an attribute
you can overwrite this.)
constructor injection:
----------------------
Constructor injection is the priamary pattern used for resolving objects (instanciating)
while resolving specific types it apples following rules.
1. If a constructor has [Inject] attribute. it is derectly use this, you can not provide [Inject] attribute to more than one 
constructors (it will throw not supported exception.)
2. If no constructor has [Inject] attribute, Ninject will select the most of the parameters Ninject will resolve (understands 
how to resolve.12qwe54  1). 
3. If no constructors are defined , Ninject will select the default parameter less constructor.
