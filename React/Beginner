1. what makes react special ? and what makes choosing react over the compitation ? 
trade off's in react design ? what you are giving up of things if you want to go with react ? 

History : Created by facebook, in 2011, later used by Instagram in 2012, 2013 open sourced .
in 2014 many outside companies adapted to React so this lead to creat React Native in 2015 (you can create native IOS applications 
for IOS and Android)

Whats now ? over 30 k components used by facebook and fb used react native for mobile development. now many of the fortune
500 compnaines utilise react in their production environment. 

Why React: 
----------
Flexibility :
-------------
React is a library not a framework 
where react created, it is created for single focus in mind to create componenets for web applciations.
You can create V.R applications using react VR 
Mobile applications using React Native
Desktop applications using tool Electron 
server rendering using Next JS ...
so finally learn react and apply any where... 


React DOM : There are different react renders ... serverside rendering you can strart with small portion 
of server side and implement and move to bigger implementations... so you can do risk free moment to React..
