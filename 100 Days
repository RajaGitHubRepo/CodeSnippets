Understanding Arrays in c#:
---------------------------
1. Searching :
Binary search methods:(For searching sorted array)
  Array.BinarySearch(Array, Object) --> 
  Array.BinarySearch(Array, Object, Icomparer) -->
For Searching unsorted Arrays:
IndexOf/LastIndexOf
Find/FindLast/FindIndex/FindLastIndex/FindAll/Exists/TrueForAll - for searching unsorted arrays for Item(S) that satisfies 
the given predicate

2. Sorting: Array.Sort requires that the elements in the arry implement IComparable. This means most built in types like int
are order by defalut. If the elements are not intrisically comparable, or you want to override the default ordering, you must 
provide Sort with a custom comparision provider that reports on the relative position of two elements. 

3. Reversing Elements

4. Copying 

5. Converting and Resizing

Usage of Action delegate in Array.ForEach method.
you can pass the action delegate and pass it to a Array Object to manipulate each element of the data.
