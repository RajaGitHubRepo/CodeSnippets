## What is reposotory 

## what is index and snap shot 

## Git Init 
## Git add . 
## Git add fileName
## Git commit -m 

## Git Log
## Git Status
## Git Diff - Difference between two commits  
   When we create a commit git automatically generates hexadecimal code. 

## Time travel to understand the changes made in each snapshot 
Since the repository maintains the snapshot of each Commit, we can 
time travel each commit we made ( each commit has hexa decimal number assigned to it)
and we can check the difference (or) what and who has changed in each commit.
