## What is reposotory 

## what is index and snap shot 

## Git Init 
## Git add . 
## Git add fileName
## Git commit -m 

## Git Log
## Git Status
## Git Diff - Difference between two commits  
   When we create a commit git automatically generates hexadecimal code. 

## Time travel to understand the changes made in each snapshot 
Since the repository maintains the snapshot of each Commit, we can 
time travel each commit we made ( each commit has hexa decimal number assigned to it)
and we can check the difference (or) what and who has changed in each commit.

Git tracks changes to source code...
How the most basic features of git works in practice.

Git is the not only version control in this world. But what makes it so special. 

Git Hub and Git eco system...

Git Init -- 
   That means put this project Under git,
   It creates a repository (Storage area) 
   Forget about the location where it creates for now
   But it will create some where to store your files
   In my computer. 

   what repo contains is it contains the snapshot of my    porject 

So next step is to create a snapshot: that we can do in two steps:

 Step 1. We must tell git proejcts which projects to add
         to the repository  
         Git add . (Put all the files in the Reporsitory).
         
         This step won't or put files on the repository, but 
         it creates a launch pad (it is also called index in GIT) and add the files to the launch pad. 

Step 2:  We can send the content of the index in to the repository.
         git commit -m "commit message" 

Now we have just created the first snap shot of the Repsoitory.
Git Log -> 

Git Status -> It shows the modified files. 
Next if you modify files 
git add filename 
git commit -m "Fix for the check-in"

It creates 2-nd snapshot on the repositoty, The second snap-shot Includes the modified file 

git diff -> difference between two commits
